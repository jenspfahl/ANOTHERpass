<b>This is ANOTHER way to manage passwords!</b>

ANOTHERpass generates easy but strong passwords for you. It uses so called <i>Pseudo Phrases</i> by default which looks like real words but are still very random and unpredictable.

It also comes with a clever two factor authentication to unlock the vault. These factors are knowledge (a PIN) and ownership (the master password). So instead of remembering a long and complicated master password you just remember the PIN and have your master password with you (as QR code or NFC tag). Additionally you can safely store it on your device using biometrics (e.g. fingerprint).

With ANOTHERpass you can store backups of the vault and the encrypted master key separately (latter e.g. as QR code on a analogue sheet). So the backup file is very useless for hackers and can safely be stored in cloud storages.


<b>Core features of the app</b>

- easy two factor authentication
- no complicated master password to memorize, it is just exported
- easy to read generated passwords
- strong modern encryption (AES 128/256, Blowfish, Chacha20)
- uses an integrated security chip or TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) if present
- Autofill support
- biometrics (e.g. fingerprint) for stored master password
- no insecure clipboard function by default
- show passwords over other apps to type it easily
- no internet connection needed, all is offline
- export and import credential vault
- export vault and master key separately (latter analogue if wished)
- share and outsource credentials
- obfuscate several passwords as additional security layer
- optional self desctruction mode after too many failed login attempts
