<b>With ANOTHERpass you don't need to create and remember a long and complex master password!</b>

ANOTHERpass comes with a clever two factor authentication to unlock the vault. These factors are knowledge (a PIN chosen by you) and ownership (the generated master password as a physical token). Instead of remembering a long and complicated master password (or a too weak one!) you just remember the PIN and have your master password or token with you (as QR code or NFC tag). Additionally, for more convenience, you can safely store it on your device using biometrics (e.g. fingerprint).

ANOTHERpass generates easy but strong passwords for you. It uses so called <i>Pseudo Phrases</i> by default which look like real words but are still very random and unpredictable. Password strength comes with its length (16 - 32 characters)!

You can also access your credentials in the app from your laptop at home or work, if you use the <a href="https://anotherpass.jepfa.de/extension">ANOTHERpass Browser Extension</a>.

Besides other features, like a powerful credential-search, grouping, import/export from and to several formats like Keepass and CSV, the app also works as a secure authenticator (2FA).
